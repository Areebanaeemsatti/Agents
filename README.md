# Multi-Agent Chat System (agents)

## Overview
This project is a **Multi-Agent Chat System** implemented in Python using **Gradio** for a web-based UI.  
It simulates an AI lab environment where multiple agents collaborate to handle user queries intelligently.

The system consists of four agents:  

- **Coordinator** – Routes queries dynamically to the appropriate agent.  
- **ResearchAgent** – Provides detailed information on topics (mock knowledge base).  
- **AnalysisAgent** – Performs reasoning, comparison, and summarization.  
- **MemoryAgent** – Stores past conversations and retrieves knowledge using similarity.
